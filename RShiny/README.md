This folder holds scripts for developed RShiny apps.

The script `MetLip_FrontEnd_shiny_app_beta` was the first version developed as a shiny app, which only handles the generation of sample meta data. 

The updated version `MetLip_FrontEnd_shiny_dashboard` utilizes the shinydashboard package for improved aesthetics and ergonomics. This script is under continued development to improve handling of plate meta data generation as well as the mass spec operating system sequence.
